## How to fork & create a branch

1. Click the **Fork** button on the top-right of the repository page to make your own copy under your GitHub account.
2. In your forked repo, create a new branch for your work. Use a descriptive branch name (see branch naming below).

```bash 
# example
git checkout -b feat/add-mobile-touch
```

---

## Clone the repo locally

Clone your fork (replace `<your-username>`):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/whack-a-mole.git
cd whack-a-mole
```

Add the original repo as an upstream remote so you can keep your fork in sync:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/piyushkdas0611/whack-a-mole.git
git fetch upstream
```

Before starting work, make sure your local `main` is up to date:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
```

---

## Run the project locally

The project is plain HTML/CSS/JS with tests using Node tools. Quick ways to run locally:

* Open `index.html` directly in a browser.
* Or use a simple local server (recommended for APIs or fetch usage):

```bash
# using Python 3
python3 -m http.server 8080
# or using npm's http-server (install if needed)
npx http-server -c-1 .
```

Install dev dependencies (for tests):

```bash
npm install
```

Run tests (see README for test scripts):

```bash
npm test
npm run test:functions
npm run vitest
```

---

## Coding standards & tests

* Follow the existing code style in the repo. If adding a new file, try to match indentation and naming.
* Keep functions small and focused.
* Add comments where logic is non-obvious.
* Avoid leaving `console.log` statements in committed code unless they are for debugging and removed later.
* Write tests for new features or bug fixes. The repo already has unit and integration tests ‚Äî aim to keep tests green.

If you want, open an issue first to discuss larger changes.

---

## Commit messages & branch naming

**Branch name conventions (examples):**

* `feat/<short-description>` ‚Äî new feature
* `fix/<short-description>` ‚Äî bug fix
* `docs/<short-description>` ‚Äî docs only
* `test/<short-description>` ‚Äî tests
* `chore/<short-description>` ‚Äî maintenance

**Commit message style (recommended ‚Äî Conventional Commits):**

* `feat: add mobile touch support`
* `fix: correct scoring when timer ends`
* `docs: update README run instructions`
* `test: add unit test for whack logic`

Write clear messages. One short summary line + optional body.

---

## Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

1. Make your changes on a branch in your fork (not directly on `main`).
2. Push the branch to your GitHub fork: `git push origin your-branch-name`.
3. Open a Pull Request against the upstream repository's `main` branch.

**PR checklist (please include before requesting review):**

* [ ] Branch name follows convention
* [ ] Tests added/updated and passing
* [ ] Lint/format (if present) 
* [ ] README or docs updated if behavior changed
* [ ] Screenshots / GIF for UI changes
